# The Magnetic Field versus Density Relation in Star-forming Molecular Clouds 
# MCMC-fitting




We study the magnetic field to density (B–ρ) relation in turbulent molecular clouds with dynamically important
magnetic fields using nonideal three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations. Our simulations show that
there is a distinguishable break density ρT between the relatively flat low-density regime and a power-law regime at
higher densities. We present an analytic theory for ρT based on the interplay of the magnetic field, turbulence, and
gravity. The break density ρT scales with the strength of the initial Alfvén Mach number A0 for sub-Alfvénic
(A0 < 1) and trans-Alfvénic (A0 ~ 1) clouds. We fit the variation of ρT for model clouds as a function of
A0, set by different values of initial sonic Mach number 0 and the initial ratio of gas pressure to magnetic
pressure β0. This implies that ρT, which denotes the transition in mass-to-flux ratio fro
